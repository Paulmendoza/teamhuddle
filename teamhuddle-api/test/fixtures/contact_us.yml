  comments: "Hello Team!\nI have accumulated a small list of critiques I thought I
    would share, to possibly make your website a more enjoyable experience for the
    users.\n\n- contact images can be smaller, and the colour can be less vibrant
    (large images and bright colours tend to distract my eyes from the more important
    information)\n- It would be nice if there is an option to filter the Dropin finder
    by price \n- The bottom right corner (social media) icons are fairly large and
    the spacing is fairly tight (it \"feels\" a little cluttered)\n- Loving the interactivity
    of the homepage and added gifs!\n\nHopefully my feedback helps,\nKeep up the great
    work! :)"

  comments: "Great site guys!  I like the choice of images used, and how the home
    page scrolls.  Seems like it's pretty user friendly when finding different sports
    to participate in.  \n\nI would use more colour on the home page.  When I think
    of sports enthusiasts, I think energetic, competitive, vibrant, and community
    driven, and I didn't get that complete feel when arriving at the page.  If the
    main banner image was in colour, that would really pop.  So I would keep the black
    and white to a minimum.  Otherwise, great layout and easy to use!"

    point and make it bigger.\n• Only have the sports that will be available. Take
    out the 'Coming Soon' boxes for now and just let people know more sports will
    be added.\n• Social sharing would work better on top nav.\n• The features part
    with 3 boxes should be on the top. Make it easy for users. \n• Is this a paid
    drop service? If not, FREE would be a good word to use somewhere."

  comments: Hi, I'd like to say that I really like how the website is simple and concise
    however some suggestions for improvements would be to make the website more interactive.
    By more interactive I mean more engaging, possibly having a live feed of the games
    playing that day, YouTube videos relating to your website or a rotating banner
    that features a different sport each week. It'll keep the audience more interested
    and engaged creating more traffic on your page. Just my personal opinion!

  comments: "Hey J,\n\nSo the drop-in finder is very cool and a bit laggy when clicking
    and for the map to find your location but nothing too annoying however, if there
    are multiple people trying to utilize it, I feel it may get laggier and freeze.\n\nFor
    the sports itself, it would be nice to see \"ball\" hockey, if it is within the
    hockey tab in general, it would be nice to see it as a separate label so people
    know the drop-in is either ice or floor.\n\nFor obvious reasons, the more sports
    the better, especially the not so known sports because people may want to play
    \"floor ball\" but don't know what it is and this would give them the opportunity
    to check it out (hence the forums to bring up other sports)\n\nA forum page would
    also be pretty good where people can say drop-ins that are not on the list and
    discuss if times change etc. It gives people the freedom to discuss the sports
    and form a community :) \n\nAll and all, this idea is cool, keep it up!"

    Hey,

    I forgot to mention that some drop-ins have a "first time free" policy, so it would be cool to mention that so when people are looking they know that they can go to those specific drop-ins and try the sport out!

    Also the interface is really nice, well done!

    YouTube icons in contacts page doesn't work
    No YouTube icon in bottom footer where other social media icons are
    When submitting with no name or email it just says error processing instead of indicating why it didn't work (ie.  No name no email error)

    so good job\nMap function seems to be working well \n\"about\" section: put yourself
    at the top with Marc, then have everyone else follow in alphabetical order - photos
    of you guys playing sports instead of normal headshots would be fun. \nhyperlinks
    to your social accounts should open in a new window\ntried to submimt my email
    to get access to beta - didnt work. should it? \nhomepage: photo looks great.
    very clear and easy to understand. i would bring your social links up to the top
    of the page. eventually will you have some sort of social feed? not sure what
    your plans are for creating that 'community' online. check out what hockey community
    does. \n\nHappy to provide more feedback if you like! \nNJ"

    Hi guys,
    This looks promising! A good feature to have is to allow users to create their own events, invite others, as well as get updated on news articles related to their interests

    Hello!  I'm looking through the website, and is there any way you can search for drop-ins just by day, or just by area..and not by sport? Say you're interested in playing ANY sport, but you're only available on Mondays, would it be possible to look up all drop-ins available just on that day instead of going through every sport individually? Is it also possible to sort the drop ins by time as well? This can make it easier to narrow down search options.

    thanks!
