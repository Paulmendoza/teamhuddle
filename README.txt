Welcome to the TeamHuddle Web App
---------------------------------

Environment:
Ruby 2.0.0
Rails 4.1

I suggest using the RubyInstaller from http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
then running

$gem install rails

from a commande prompt.

After pulling this repo, navigate a command prompt to the app directory (where
Gemfile is located) and run

$bundle install
and
$bundle update
